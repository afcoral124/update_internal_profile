        "Industry / Model": "Healthcare services that meet real needs (home health, ABA therapy, PT/OT/speech, dermatology, optometry, audiology)",
        "Why client is excited (quote/summary)": "\"If it's a great business that happens to be in healthcare, I think it's a huge win.\" \"Healing others is the highest calling.\" \"I would happily pay 5x for that.\"",
        "Notes / caveats": "ABA remains top interest, but excitement in Arizona is tempered by Medicaid risk. Current ABA/HCBS target is 75% HCBS/25% ABA with ~96% Medicaid; likely AZ rate cuts make him cautious and he may walk unless a large standby/forgivable seller note shifts policy risk. Prefers pure-play ABA with a balanced payer mix and stronger rates (for example, SoCal Medi‑Cal clinics have much higher reimbursement). Local Phoenix is ideal. Wants recurring demand, low concentration, clear DSCR, and to avoid heavy Medicaid at‑home mix unless protected. Mid‑January 2026: said he is \"mentally checked out\" on the current AZ target; the state moved to dismiss the Centria v. MercyCare case; he will push a re‑trade and set an end‑of‑January go/no‑go."

        "Rank": "2",
        "Industry / Model": "IT Managed Service Providers and cybersecurity services",
        "Why client is excited (quote/summary)": "\"MSPs are sticky… I know the industry kind of intimately.\" \"Unfair advantage.\" Also sees cyber \"only going to blow up.\" Called a healthcare IT + MSP deal \"super cool.\" \"Much closer fit with my background.\"",
        "Notes / caveats": "LOI fully signed (early Jan 2026) on a healthcare IT + MSP. Seeks contracted revenue and channel familiarity. Avoids heavy paid ads. Prefers low capex, steady renewals. Cautiously optimistic; notes it may be \"buying a job\" for 12–24 months, but the seller will stay 2–3 years and there is a growth roadmap. He said, \"VARs are in a weird contracting middle ground… I’m not looking to overpay for a VAR. What I really want is a solid platform MSP.\" He also called the space \"cutthroat,\" so he will favor sticky MRR and platform MSPs over pure resellers. After meeting the seller, he said the business is very owner‑dependent and \"he does three people's jobs\"; Pushkar is on the fence unless he can hire near‑shore support fast and use working capital to fund 1–2 early hires. He is \"not excited\" to be the only one handling tickets for 2–3 years. Likes hosted PBX recurring and an agentic‑AI after‑hours cross‑sell; small colo/server capex is fine. Lender outreach queued. Phoenix first; open to SoCal if stand‑out."

        "Industry / Model": "HVAC service and maintenance (esp. Phoenix and commercial)",
        "Why client is excited (quote/summary)": "\"If your air conditioning is not working, there is no higher necessity than that.\"",
        "Notes / caveats": "Licensed trade. He is \"up for the challenge\" and sees licensing as a moat. Needs a compliant qualifier plan until he earns his own license; learned his engineering degree counts toward required experience and expects about two years of qualifier support. Prefers strong service contract base and predictable DSCR. Avoids heavy new‑construction exposure and bid‑only work."

        "Why client is excited (quote/summary)": "\"Everyone dies.\" Clear need and recurring nature appealed to him.",

        "Notes / caveats": "Focus on sticky services and financing models that keep retention high. Avoid purely cosmetic fads. Scottsdale is attractive given demand. Wants proven DSCR and trained staff."
