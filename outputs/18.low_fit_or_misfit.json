      "For MSPs, target 60%+ revenue in MRR, 12–36 month terms, clear stack, and QBRs.",

      "ABA lender reality: multiple lenders want about $750k of the seller note on full 10-year standby; Live Oak also wants two BCBAs on 5-year employment agreements (no PG or equity). Bring these terms into structure talks early.",
      "Owner-does-it-all MSPs: treat as a misfit unless there is a fast, funded plan to hire near-shore/offshore support (1–2 hires in year one), a clear role handoff, and the seller stays on 2–3 years at fair market pay.",
      "Benchmark-style gatekeeping: expect long buyer profiles, IOIs instead of LOIs, no asking price, and limited seller calls before IOI. Time-box effort and proceed only if quality and fit are high."
