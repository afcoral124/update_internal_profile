  "9) Personal & Family Context": {
    "Spouse/partner (name if shared, profession if relevant)": [
      "Nidhi (Product Manager in tech)",
      "Notes: Has a psychology minor; this helps with credibility and communication if they buy an ABA clinic. She will front-face day to day in a female-dominated clinic and is leading lender-package work (personal docs, business plan, SWOT, operator pitch) during diligence."
    ],
    "Role in Decisions": [
      "Equal partner. Active in diligence and final approval. Plans to quit her W-2 and go full-time in the clinic at close; Pushkar may keep his W-2 short term as a backstop until the business stabilizes.",
      "Family support and dynamics: Mother-in-law lives in Phoenix and is part of their local support system (helpful for childcare and transition)."
    ],
    "Children/dependents (ages if relevant)": [
      "Daughter: Anya (born Sep 30, 2023; turned 2 on Sep 30, 2025)",
      "Childcare: Full-time nanny by choice (not daycare). Childcare costs are a known monthly expense.",
      "Pet: Golden Retriever (\"Charlie,\" ~5 years old as of Aug 2025)"
    ],
    "Key dates (birthdays, anniversaries) for relationship/scheduling)": [
      "Wedding year: 2016 (exact date not shared) - please confirm",
      "Anya's birthday: September 30 (born 2023)",
      "Charlie's birthday: October 7",
      "Pushkar's birthday: September 9",
      "Nidhi's birthday: not shared - please provide",
      "Open items to confirm: Exact wedding anniversary date (year is 2016); Nidhi's birthday"
    ],
    "Lifestyle priorities: hours, travel, relocation boundaries": [
      "Evenings are family time. Dinner around 6 pm, then bedtime routine for Anya. Avoid evening calls; no calls after 10 pm.",
      "Mornings are best for work and calls. Early workouts. Comfortable with 5-8 am calls when needed. Prefers focused morning work blocks.",
      "Health routines matter (sauna/cold, workouts). Keep these protected to avoid burnout.",
      "Travel: Prefers local, not heavy travel. No late-night work culture. Weekends are flexible if needed.",
      "Location: Local-first in Greater Phoenix (within ~1 hour). Open to Southern California for the right deal. Avoid snowy locations. No frequent long commutes.",
      "Will not live away from family during the week. Short transition travel (about 30-90 days) is okay; after that he wants to be home nightly.",
      "Would only relocate for a truly life-changing deal. Moving to California feels impractical due to family and housing logistics, and he is unsure a new mortgage would be possible right after closing.",
      "Communication and scheduling notes for the team: Schedule key calls in the morning AZ time (Arizona MST, no daylight saving). Avoid evenings.",
      "His W-2 employer now requires full calendar visibility; he may block a \"lunch\" window for our calls during weekdays to keep details private.",
      "Keep updates clear and structured (checklists, next steps, timelines). Share lender notes or written proof when relevant so Nidhi can review.",
      "Slack is fine for quick questions. Summaries and action lists help him keep momentum.",
      "Respect family time windows; propose early blocks for deep-dive working sessions."
    ],
    "Motivation & long-term vision": [
      "Why now: Both Pushkar and Nidhi were laid off within weeks while caring for their infant, which dropped household income to zero. That shock, and the \"customer concentration\" risk of a single employer, pushed them to own their outcome.",
      "Personal drivers: Build useful things, see direct impact, and create a stable, fulfilling life for family. Own equity instead of renting time.",
      "Vision: Buy a resilient, needs-based service business with recurring revenue and 10+ employees. Improve operations first, then grow with bolt-on acquisitions. Hold long-term if it's a great platform; not chasing a quick flip. Nidhi may later acquire or run a second business."
