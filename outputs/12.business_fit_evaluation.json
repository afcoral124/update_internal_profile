        "Sets clear gates and holds a normal sequence even with broker pressure (template APA, \"non-binding\" exclusivity talk). Runs live modeling, plans early hires and working capital, and keeps weekly seller calls moving. Strong direction-setting; watch time management while juggling W-2, two LOIs, and broker friction."

        "Despite fatigue and being mentally checked out on the ABA deal, he keeps gathering facts, plans a re-trade, and set an end-of-month go/no-go. Handles gatekeeping brokers and slow sellers while staying calm and ready to walk if risk cannot shift."

      "Notes": [
        "Handles Medicaid policy risk and litigation tracking on ABA while also planning staffing, small capex, and working-capital/LOC needs on an owner‑dependent MSP (hosted PBX expansion). Uses AI checks before QoE. Comfortable with regulated, paperwork‑heavy processes and sequencing."

      "Notes": [
        "Does not want to \"be the only one\" doing support and projects for 2–3 years (talked about 150 tickets/day). Plans to hire near‑shore help in year one and protect family evenings. Best fit is a business with a small team or a fast path to one; avoid 24/7 or single‑person support models."

    "Values alignment (legacy, community, employees)": {
      "Score": "5/5",
      "Notes": [
        "Insists on fair, standard process that protects both sides. Plans to keep and grow teams and avoid risky structures that could hurt staff. Healthcare mission remains strong; respects seller legacy and wants a stable, long‑term platform."
