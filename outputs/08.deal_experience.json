        "Deal Name": "Framing and Carpentry Company — Riverside/Inland Empire, CA",
        "Date of Last Update": "2025-10-22",
        "Current Status / Notes": "Active modeling and LOI prep. Seller call went well; rapport remains strong. Broker (Scott) is very responsive and appears early in his career. Backlog letter shows three projected future jobs with Holland Construction/Holland Partners (Sunset Echo, Liberty, Magnolia), roughly high‑20s to ~$30M combined; several large jobs already awarded and started. Future backlog is concentrated with one builder; overall customer base is 2–4 customers. Pushkar adjusted SDE to ~ $800k to include ~$200k salary for the 10% partner who wants to stay employed long term; will keep purchase agreement language SBA‑compliant (seller/partner employment limited to 12 months on paper). Considering a creative, SBA‑compliant structure: cash at close in the ~2.0x–2.3x range of seller’s SDE, total consideration around ~3.5x–4.2x of Pushkar’s adjusted SDE, and a 20%–33% performance‑based, forgivable seller note tied pro rata to 2024 revenue or to project realization (not an earnout). Macro caution on multifamily/new‑build; hiring capacity to deliver backlog is a risk. Working capital/LOC use remains a concern. Next: Submit a formal LOI using the firm template by Monday (week of 2025‑10‑27), include normalized NWC set post‑diligence and performance‑note protection; may add a short intro video with the LOI."

        "Current Status / Notes": "Exploratory. Ryan spoke with broker. CIM shows ~$2M cash flow with an ask near ~7.5x; heavy PP&E with an estimated $10M liquidation value. Listed in AZ but operated in Utah; owner puts in ~5–10 hours/month; not a fully stacked management team. Price structure and asset base discussed; no next steps set."

        "Deal Name": "Local ABA Clinic (Autism therapy; Phoenix Metro)",
        "Date of Last Update": "2026-01-20",
        "Current Status / Notes": "LOI fully executed. Exclusivity 90 days + 30‑day mutual extension. $30k escrow payable at APA; excluding real estate (lease in place). Active risk review: about 96% Medicaid exposure across ABA (86% of ABA) and HCBS sides. Live Oak asked for reimbursement history and 2026 outlook; Pathward is interested; broker Ishan is running term sheets; Bruce (First Bank of the Lake) is waiting on balance sheets (seller delayed due to reconciling a large withdrawal). Pushkar requested fee schedules and reimbursement statements to see if MercyCare cuts have already hit. Considering re‑trade: move roughly half of the $1.5M seller note to full 10‑year standby and keep the rest performance‑based; also exploring a larger policy‑tied, forgivable note if rate cuts occur in 3–5 years. He obtained quotes: healthcare counsel ($5k retainer; $10k–$20k billed at close) and Treewalk QoE (~$13k; early fatal‑flaw no‑charge approach). Modeling shows DSCR risk if cuts land; may walk if structure cannot de‑risk. Late‑Dec updates: Pathward issued a term sheet; Live Oak sent a preliminary term sheet; multiple lenders asked that about $750k of the seller note be on full 10‑year standby; Live Oak currently wants two BCBAs on 5‑year employment agreements (no PG or equity). Site visit completed; will push re‑trade on seller notes using term sheets. Mid‑Jan: seller travel and slow responses; still waiting on billing reports and fee schedules. The state filed a motion to dismiss the Centria v. MercyCare case; governor’s budget due soon. Pushkar is mentally checked out; plans to push a re‑trade next week and set an end‑of‑January go/no‑go; Wendy (Live Oak) is back from vacation and he will brief lenders candidly."

        "Current Status / Notes": "LOI fully signed (early Jan 2026). Met seller (Sam) in person; strong rapport. Business is highly owner‑dependent: Sam handles most support, projects, and daily ops; 50% partner is passive. Seller is willing to stay 3–5 years at about $100k/year. Broker (Mo, Transworld) pushed a template APA and claimed LOI exclusivity is non‑binding; heavy gatekeeping of seller contact. Plan: use the 25‑day window to secure full financials and hold weekly seller calls, then revert to a normal sequence with a buyer‑drafted APA. Lenders: Jared (First Internet) asked for a full file once docs arrive; Tom Lyons (Byline) did a 1‑hour intro, is interested, and quoted Prime + ~2%, pending documents. Modeling: testing higher equity injection and a working‑capital tranche/LOC to fund 1–2 near‑shore hires in year one; small capex for hosted PBX expansion (Dallas/PA). Evaluating key‑person risk versus platform upside while keeping DSCR fundable."
