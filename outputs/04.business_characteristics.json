  "4) Business Characteristics (internal-only detail)": {
    "Preferred employee count / team structure": [
      "Prefers 10+ employees so the owner is not doing all the work.",
      "Comfortable leading cross-functional teams with clear roles.",
      "Best fit is a crew-based service business with working supervisors or a dispatcher already in place.",
      "Will add or retain a licensed qualifier or senior manager where required.",
      "Will model fair market pay for key leaders into SDE and budget accordingly (open to keeping a former owner/partner on payroll if it adds stability).",
      "Open to a smaller team on a strong MSP if the seller stays 2–3 years and there is a clear growth path.",
      "Will stand up near-shore or offshore support hires early to handle tickets and free up owner time (one to two people in year one if cash flow allows)."
    ],
    "Customer base preferences": [
      "Open to B2B or B2C, with a strong preference for recurring contracts and high retention.",
      "Likes local, geographically protected customer bases that favor incumbents.",
      "Wants a diverse book of customers and will avoid heavy customer concentration; in construction, knows some concentration is typical and will seek protections if a few customers dominate. Would favor ultra‑high‑end residential clients over developer‑heavy multifamily exposure.",
      "In healthcare, wants a balanced payer mix; will avoid very high Medicaid concentration (for example, 80–90%+) unless there is a clear plan or protective terms."
    ],
    "Growth profile": [
      "Prefers steady, recession-resistant businesses with a long track record.",
      "Comfortable with light operational improvements and bolt-on acquisitions.",
      "Not looking for distressed turnarounds or high-burn, hypergrowth plays.",
      "Wants limited exposure to new construction cycles; prefers maintenance/repair or replacement demand with clear backlog.",
      "Wants the first 12–24 months de‑risked with real backlog or contracts; backlog helps but does not replace macro/cycle risks.",
      "Will pass on deals where policy-driven reimbursement cuts could wipe out DSCR unless terms shift risk (for example, large standby or forgivable seller note).",
      "Open to “buying a job” for 12–24 months in a smaller MSP if growth levers are real and the seller supports the transition.",
      "Prefers a recurring base that can cover most or all debt service so growth can be funded from cash flow."
    ],
    "Sales/marketing intensity tolerance": [
      "Does not want a business that relies on heavy outbound sales or constant paid ads to survive.",
      "Prefers inbound demand, referrals, contract renewals, and relationship-driven sales.",
      "Will invest in improving sales process and account management, but wants an existing base to start from.",
      "Avoids models that depend on Google search traffic or algorithm changes for lead flow (passed on an e‑commerce deal for this reason)."
    ],
    "Operational complexity": [
      "Comfortable with single-site or multi-crew dispatch models if routes and schedules are predictable.",
      "Field operations are fine if SOPs, basic systems, and safety practices exist.",
      "Open to licensed trades if there is a clear plan for licensing coverage during the transition.",
      "Comfortable with regulated healthcare clinic operations and payer-driven models (for example, Medicaid), and understands registration/transfer can take about 5–6 months; will plan for heavier diligence.",
      "In healthcare deals, wants a mixed payer base and prefers to grow higher‑margin, in‑clinic services so the business is not too dependent on Medicaid at‑home revenue.",
      "Understands Medicaid reimbursement is state-specific; will ask for rate history and outlook and slow down or walk away if near‑term cuts are likely.",
      "In Arizona licensed trades, his engineering degree counts toward experience; needs about two years of qualifier/license coverage during transition and views this as manageable."
    ],
    "Asset-heavy vs. service-based": [
      "Strong preference for service-based, low CapEx models.",
      "Comfortable with trucks, tools, and light equipment tied to recurring maintenance.",
      "Avoids heavy fleet, large inventory, or real-estate-heavy models that drag returns.",
      "Okay with light IT capex like servers and colocation racks tied to recurring hosted services (for example, hosted PBX)."
    ],
    "Cultural fit": [
      "Values stable, family-owned companies where the seller cares about legacy and staff.",
      "Plans to keep and grow the team; open to a former owner or minority partner staying employed long term at fair pay if it adds stability; otherwise prefers the seller in a short consultative role.",
      "Sees regulatory and licensing discipline as a moat, not a burden.",
      "Operates with a stakeholder mindset: treat customers and employees well, improve systems, grow steadily.",
      "For female‑dominated clinical teams, plans for Nidhi to front‑face day to day during transition to lower risk; he will co‑lead."
    ],
    "Hidden NOs / soft preferences": [
      "Needs-over-wants bias: will avoid luxury or discretionary consumer categories unless there is a sticky, clinical element.",
      "Real estate: prefers to lease; will buy if priced fairly and required. When leasing, prefers a right of first refusal to buy later; will also exclude CRE from a deal if it complicates closing or drags returns.",
      "Sales engine: avoids businesses that require building a heavy outbound or paid-ads engine from scratch.",
      "Concentration: wants low concentration; will pass on companies where one or two customers dominate, especially when future backlog is tied to one builder. If unavoidable, he wants deal terms that protect against losing a big customer.",
      "Online-only risk: not interested in ad/affiliate content sites, dropshipping, or FBA; SaaS only if niche, sticky, and reasonably priced.",
      "Search-traffic dependence: will avoid businesses reliant on Google SEO/algorithm-driven traffic for leads or sales.",
      "Transportation rentals: not interested in car rentals, taxis, or RV dealerships.",
      "Project-only trades: prefers service trades with maintenance contracts; pure one-off project revenue is less attractive unless paired with recurring service plans.",
      "New construction heavy revenue: will avoid businesses mainly tied to new builds; lumpy, bid-only work without backlog is a poor fit.",
      "Seasonality: will avoid highly seasonal, tourism-driven revenue without strong counter-season buffers.",
      "Working capital intensity: will avoid businesses that need large ongoing working capital (big AR or inventory swings, heavy line-of-credit use) that make cash flow lumpy.",
      "Heavy Medicaid dependence without a path to diversify payer mix; not okay with 80–90%+ Medicaid.",
      "Hybrid ABA + HCBS models with big reimbursement risk on both sides unless heavily de‑risked (for example, standby/forgivable seller note, strong cash cushion).",
      "One‑payer or policy‑dependent revenue that can be cut mid‑stream without protection.",
      "IT resellers (VAR) without sticky service revenue; prefers MSP platforms and will not overpay for a reseller‑only model."
