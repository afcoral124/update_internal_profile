  "11) Psychology & Coaching Insights": {
    "Decision-making style": [
      "Works best with clear facts, simple models, and lender-confirmed rules. Medium-fast pace once he has data. Wants a few good options with one recommendation, not a long menu. Won't make offers without meeting the seller first. Only proposes structures that protect him. Runs parallel options until spending is required. Wants written proof before deciding - escrow agreements, lender emails, fee schedules. Stages re-trades at clear points (after term sheets, then after QoE). Will walk away if facts show high risk, even after investing time. Refuses rushed timelines or documents signed out of sequence. Sets clear go/no-go dates and uses short windows (for example, 25 days) to gather facts and hold weekly seller calls, then insists on a normal sequence with a buyer-drafted APA."

    "Motivators": [
      "Family stability and control after losing both jobs while caring for infant daughter. Building useful things with direct impact. Owning equity instead of \"renting time.\" Being present for his young daughter. Healthcare mission, especially helping children with autism. Growing through steady improvements and acquisitions. Being a good employer who keeps teams together. Escaping corporate politics and calendar surveillance. Long-term credibility with institutional investors for future deals."
    ],
    "Fears / sensitivities": [
      "Overpaying or having weak debt coverage. Shrinking markets or outdated products. Heavy customer concentration where one client can sink the deal. New construction exposure and cyclical revenue. Large working capital needs and unclear financial details. Algorithm-dependent businesses after past CAC failures. Being forced to fund working capital at close. Medicaid rate cuts that destroy margins. Sellers who delay basic documents or have unexplained withdrawals. Brokers who waste time with poor communication. Pressure to rush decisions without facts. Work schedules that hit family dinner time. Extreme owner dependence and key person risk where the seller does most of the work. Brokers who gatekeep seller contact or play games with process (template APAs, talk of non-binding exclusivity or backup offers during exclusivity)."
    ],
    "Stress triggers": [
      "Broker delays and missing CIMs after signing NDAs. Being asked for LOIs before meeting sellers. Night or weekend work requirements. No clear timelines or decision points. Vague \"wait for updates\" with no dates. Requests for money without written release terms. Being asked to sign binding documents before diligence. Passive-aggressive behavior after private agreements. Heavy line-of-credit needs that would \"trash his sleep.\" Employer forcing calendar visibility on his calls. Waiting weeks for basic financials or rate documents. Shortened diligence windows like 25 days. Gatekeeping of seller contact, sellers missing or skipping agreed calls, or brokers talking about backup offers during an exclusivity period."
    ],
    "Coping style": [
      "Resets with checklists and clear next steps. Uses data and written proof to regain confidence (models, lender notes, documents). Sends pre-qualification letter to calm broker concerns. Leans on weekly peer calls for accountability. Protects morning workout and sauna routines. Runs practice deals to stay sharp. Asks specific questions in Slack for quick guidance. Gets term sheets early as \"mini-QoE\" before paying for diligence. Keeps two deals moving until one requires paid work. Has wife Nidhi lead clinical teams during transition. Delegates lender packages to Nidhi while he handles equity. Names sunk costs and walks when needed. States \"standard process or walk\" to reset expectations. Uses AI checks to reconcile cash to books and set a working capital peg before paying for QoE. During compressed windows, asks for weekly seller calls and builds rapport to offset broker friction. Time-boxes decisions with end-of-month go/no-go and will push a re-trade or walk. Models higher equity and a working capital line to hire near-shore help early so he is not the only one handling tickets."

    "Preferred communication": [
      "Direct and structured - big picture first, then 3-5 key facts, then clear ask. Morning Arizona time works best. Slack for quick items. Written recaps with checklists after calls. Wants simple models showing debt coverage at a glance. Share lender emails or policy documents when rules matter. Give 2-3 paths with one clear recommendation. Set concrete deadlines and next steps. Before broker calls, review his questions via Slack. Keep updates brief with clear owners and dates. During exclusivity, wants recurring weekly seller calls and expects direct seller contact information."

    "Development areas": [
      "Direct sales - never carried quota, needs simple playbook for renewals and light outbound. Performance marketing - past venture failed on customer costs, needs help judging channels and CAC limits. Field team management - limited small business experience, needs hiring and retention basics. Female clinical teams - needs trust-building plan with Nidhi leading. Healthcare billing - called this his \"biggest gap,\" needs code analysis and payer mix help. Arizona licensing - unclear on qualifier arrangements until earning own license. LOI structuring - wants guidance on seller notes and working capital that meet SBA rules. Due diligence timing - needs step-by-step plan to avoid paying attorneys too early. Broker management - low NDA-to-CIM rates, needs systematic follow-up process. Deal momentum - keeping energy through ups and downs is his biggest challenge. Working capital analysis - confused about normalized NWC and what's included in price. Multi-entity financials - struggles with combined statements hiding individual performance. Post-close planning - questions about mortgages and liquidity after acquisition. MSP owner-dependence reality - needs help deciding if taking on 2-3 roles for 12-18 months is acceptable and a simple plan to hire near-shore support fast while keeping DSCR safe. Broker gatekeeping - needs scripts to get direct seller access and hold a normal sequence when brokers push template APAs or claim exclusivity is non-binding."
