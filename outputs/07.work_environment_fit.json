  "7) Work Environment Fit": {
    "Preferred work environment": [
      "Pushkar thrives in structured settings with clear authority to make decisions once he has the facts. He works best with defined processes - SOPs, checklists, dispatch calendars, and weekly KPI reviews. He needs a balance of focused morning work time for planning and analysis, followed by direct interaction with field teams and office staff.",
      "The ideal environment follows normal business sequences with clear milestones and timelines. He expects decision makers present in meetings, not just intermediaries. He values direct, respectful communication with honest feedback handled one-on-one.",
      "His optimal schedule starts early (comfortable with 5 am calls) with evenings reserved for family dinner at 6 pm. He can handle occasional weekend work for key deadlines but not as a regular pattern. Any relocation travel should be limited to 30-90 days for transition.",
      "For healthcare settings with female-dominated teams, his wife Nidhi will lead day-to-day operations during transition to build trust. He prefers businesses with existing processes for safety, compliance, and licensing that he can improve over time.",
      "The best fit is a local Phoenix business (within 1 hour) with 10+ employees, recurring contracts, and steady renewal-based revenue rather than heavy cold calling or paid advertising dependence.",
      "Wants customer support and field work covered by a small team or rotation (including near-shore help if needed) so he is not the only one handling daily tickets. He prefers time to work on improvements, not just react to issues all day."
    ],
    "Work environments to avoid": [
      "Night and weekend-heavy operations without rotation plans will cause burnout and conflict with family time. He explicitly stated \"I won't\" take calls after 10 pm. Any 24/7 on-call responsibility needs established coverage.",
      "Constant travel, long commutes, or Monday-Friday away arrangements are dealbreakers. He left consulting to avoid this lifestyle and will only consider brief transition periods.",
      "High-chaos operations with no systems, constantly shifting priorities, or crisis-mode management will drain his energy. He also avoids environments with slow approval layers, office politics, or passive-aggressive leadership styles.",
      "Businesses requiring heavy cold-calling or paid advertising to survive don't match his skills. He's particularly averse to algorithm-dependent models after past failures with customer acquisition costs.",
      "Owner-bottleneck situations where nothing can be delegated frustrate him, as do vague timelines with no clear decision points. He needs structured progress, not indefinite waiting periods.",
      "Any business pushing late evening customer service or nightlife hours conflicts with his family routine. Similarly, extreme seasonality without steady workflow planning creates stress he wants to avoid.",
      "Single-person support models where the owner must answer most tickets, run projects, and handle daily operations for years. High-volume reactive support without a team or rotation will burn him out."
